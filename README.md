# Gym_Frozen_Lake
I train an agent on the gym frozen lake environment 

https://www.gymlibrary.dev/_images/frozen_lake.gif

The environment description is available here : https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/


There are 2 properties of the env.
 - Slippery model : at each movement, the agent have a certain probability to slip and to move on another case
 - Non slippery model : the agent moves normaly. 
 
 __The slippery model need more training to obtain a good score__

 __The non slippery model is more efficient__
